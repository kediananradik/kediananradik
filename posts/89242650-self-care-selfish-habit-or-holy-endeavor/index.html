We may omit ‘vision’ here for spiritual purposes, and apply it more literally to our physical well-being. In the Old Testament, the prophet Elijah was so overwhelmed he fled for his life, only to collapse under a tree near death before God’s intervention (1 Kings 19).\nJesus, in telling the parable of the Good Samaritan, instructed we must love even ourselves (Luke 10:25-37). We cannot be Christ’s servants to others if we’re burned out. The adage about putting the oxygen mask on first before assisting others also has its roots in the wisdom of Exodus 18:19–20, where Jethro admonishes Moses to delegate some of his administrative responsibilities to lighten his own workload.\nBiblical Concepts of Self-Care The words “selfish” and “self-care” do not align in Scripture, where tending to our emotional, spiritual, and physical welfare carries positive connotations.\nSabbath rest (Ex. 20:8–11; Deut 5:12–15): Set aside one day a week for rest, acknowledging God as Creator and yourself as his beloved image-bearer. The Hebrew root of “Sabbath” implies rest from, or abandonment to, God. Wise Stewardship: The Bible repeatedly condemns excessive workaholism and the neglect of other important endeavors (Ecclesiastes, 2:22–23, 5:17–18). Joseph disciplines his brothers, later revealing himself, saying, “You meant evil against me; but God meant it for good” (Genesis 50:20). Through hardship and challenges, even a deep transformation might occur. Loving your Neighbor: We are called to love our neighbor as ourselves (Luke 10:27). Loving one’s own soul allows us to love others more effectively. The Role of Psychological Concepts Psychological insights can augment our biblical understanding. Healthy, realistic self-regard is not self-absorption or self-indulgence. Jesus said, “Love your neighbor as yourself” not as a stranger. Secular psychology offers practical tools for nurturing healthier selves, for the benefit of ourselves and those around us.\nMindfulness: Sustained attention to one’s inner experience, helping manage stress and stimulating compassion for self and others (Kabat-Zinn). Positive Self-Talk: Research shows that self-affirming statements can neutralize the effects of negative stereotypes, boost academic performance, and improve immune system function. Self-Compassion: Physiologically, reacting to our own pain as we would to a friend’s distress, making it possible to cope with one’s vulnerabilities without self-hatred (Kristin Neff). None of these ideas undermine biblical faith. Many scriptural characters dealt with their own mental and emotional struggles, using the means available at the time for resilience and redemption.\nConclusion The idea of self-care is not a modern fad but an essential aspect of human flourishing. It includes paying attention to our well-being while connecting us more strongly to our families, friends, congregations, and the communities we serve.\nAs believers, we can adopt a balanced view of self-care. It’s not a selfish pursuit, but rather a vital means of holiness and wholeness, enabling us to love and serve others more effectively.\n“Bird in Hand” photo courtesy of Alexandra Simpson.\nAdditional Resource: Explore more from Ellen and her book, Tending Souls: Spiritual Care Skills for Unpredic table Times, which teaches us how to use a range of methods (with scriptural support) to address personal resilience and care for others.\n","wordCount":"672","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2024-03-09T12:51:57Z","dateModified":"2024-03-09T12:51:57Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://kediananradik.github.io/posts/89242650-self-care-selfish-habit-or-holy-endeavor/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Kedianan Radik","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://kediananradik.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://kediananradik.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Kedianan Radik (Alt + H)">Kedianan Radik</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Self-Care: Selfish Habit or Holy Endeavor?</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2024-03-09 12:51:57 +0000 UTC'>March 9, 2024</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><ul><li><a href=# aria-label="The Danger of Extreme Neglect">The Danger of Extreme Neglect</a></li><li><a href=# aria-label="Biblical Concepts of Self-Care">Biblical Concepts of Self-Care</a></li><li><a href=# aria-label="The Role of Psychological Concepts">The Role of Psychological Concepts</a></li><li><a href=# aria-label=Conclusion>Conclusion</a></li></ul></div></details></div><div class=post-content><p>Many in our culture regard self-care as a selfish habit.
