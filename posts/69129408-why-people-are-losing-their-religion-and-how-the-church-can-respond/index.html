In the U.S, for example, only 77 percent of millennials identify as religious compared to 90 percent of baby boomers.\nSo why are people—particularly younger generations—losing their religion? According to a study conducted by Baylor, Fuller and the University of Akron, there are three main factors:\nNegative experiences with religion or religious figures Differences in worldview Decreased religious importance Let’s explore each of these.\n1. Negative Experiences with Religion or Religious Figures While there are many positive experiences that people have had through their faith, there have also been negative and sometimes traumatic experiences. There are instances of religious hypocrisy, immorality or simply outright abuse. In a number of documented cases, people have left the church due to overzealous judgment, or due to the repulsion of conservative views taken in the name of religion. People sometimes equate the church with the negative experiences they’ve encountered within it, turning away from organized religion. In this light, the church must focus on removing as many barriers as possible to Jesus. Paul admonished the Corinthians, and by extension the church today, to do as he himself had done: avoid giving an occasion for stumbling. (1 Corinthians 8:9, 10:32)\n2. Differences in Worldview Some people outgrow the literal understanding of religious teachings that they were introduced to in childhood. They face the complexities of the world and wonder at how certain aspects of their religious teaching align with these realities. For example, the biblical depiction of the creation doesn’t match the scientific account of evolution. They may also question whether a God that allows for suffering and hardship can be all-good and all-powerful. While these are difficult topics, they’re not indicative of an anti-God stance but rather an openness to engage with the realities of life. The church must foster environments where such questions are openly and lovingly discussed. Theologian Karl Barth once said, “If I had to preach to myself, I would feel extremely uncomfortable, for I should be forced to acknowledge my own ignorance.” Recognizing the mystery behind God’s ways may also be an opportunity for the church to communicate humility, which was also Jesus’ approach. (See Mark 10:17–27)\n3. Decreased Religious Importance In a society that places a higher emphasis on individualism and personal satisfaction, the unconditional love and service that accompany a committed spiritual lifestyle can lose relevance to some. In a world that idealizes autonomy, religion seems to place a premium on dependence, submission and unquestioning obedience. The result is that people are less likely to choose a tradition that appears to offer less personal freedom. Today, many find greater meaning through individualism, and the appeal of the mystic experience may be lost against a backdrop of social connection via technology. In response, the church mustdemonstrate that being religious is not about becoming a slave to dogma but about a free and wholehearted response to God and the betterment of humanity. After all, Jesus came preaching the gospel of the Kingdom, which involves freedom and an invitation to the better life (Isaiah 61:1-3; Matthew 4:17-23, Luke 4:18).\nIn the face of these challenges, the church must embrace its own mission anew, remembering that the good news of the Gospel is, in fact, that of God’s transformative love in Christ. In a world of imperfection, judgmentalism and moral ambiguity, the church can shine the light of Jesus’ love.\nJesus’ life and teachings were about enriching human experience and freeing us from our self-imposed prisons. This may be the only thing that will endure as people salk through their various spiritual ups and downs. By focusing on these truths, and being the welcoming, compassionate, transforming presence that God calls us to be, the church may well become the destination for the wayward among the ‘nones.’\n","wordCount":"679","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2024-03-02T18:44:59Z","dateModified":"2024-03-02T18:44:59Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://kediananradik.github.io/posts/69129408-why-people-are-losing-their-religion-and-how-the-church-can-respond/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Kedianan Radik","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://kediananradik.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://kediananradik.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Kedianan Radik (Alt + H)">Kedianan Radik</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Why People Are Losing Their Religion (and How the Church Can Respond)</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2024-03-02 18:44:59 +0000 UTC'>March 2, 2024</span></div></header><div class=post-content><p>According to a 2012 Pew Research Center report, one-fifth of all religiously affiliated people have either left their religion or dropped out of organized religion altogether in what’s known as the “nones.” The rise of the nones is a trend in many Western countries, including the U.S., Canada, Germany, Ireland, Australia and the United Kingdom.
