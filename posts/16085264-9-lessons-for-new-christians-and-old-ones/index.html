Many of these goals are often specific to health, money, relationships, or career. While being new Christians, we may want to use the freshness and enthusiasm of a new year to resolve to focus on our faith journey and the development of certain spiritual habits.\nHere are nine lessons that can serve as a sort of spiritual resolution, whether we're new to the faith or we've been walking in it for a while.\n1. Read the Bible More Consistently In order to develop a closer relationship with God, we first must know Him better. The best, and in a sense, the only way to get to know God is through His Word. Make it a priority to read the Bible at least daily, if not more frequently. Choose a translation that is approachable and makes sense to you, like the New International Version (NIV).\nConsider also setting a time of day and a place for your devotions so that reading the Bible becomes a regular and important part of your daily routine.\n2. Pray More Often As Christian believers, we should never lose sight of the power and privilege of simply talking with God. The more we talk with Him, the more He becomes the center of our lives, and the more we’ll be filled with His direction and blessings.\nGet into the habit of praying multiple times a day, or keeping track of your prayers in a prayer journal.\n3. Be Baptized in Water and in the Spirit If you haven’t already, commit your life to Christ through baptism, a public expression of your new faith. Jesus Himself was baptized, and the Bible instructs that you should do the same (Matt. 3:13-17). If you already are a baptized believer, be open to the possibility of being baptized in the Holy Spirit, which is an empowering experience of the presence and gifts of the Holy Spirit (Acts 2).\n4. Seek Out Christian Fellowship The importance of Christian community cannot be emphasized enough. God never intended that we go through life alone, but rather that we would be in relationship with other believers, sharing a common faith journey. Attend a local church regularly and get involved in its activities and small groups.\n5. Witness to Your Faith Jesus wants followers who are so in awe of Him and his love, that they can't help but tell others about it. Consider inviting a friend to church or sharing your personal testimony with someone. Show others Jesus by the way you live your life and the love youshow to others.\n6. Share in the Lord's Supper Regularly The Lord’s Supper, also called Communion, is a special time in which we remember Christ’s sacrifice and receive a fresh infusion of spiritual strength. Regularly participate in this practice, as instructed in 1 Corinthians 11:23-26.\n7. Give Generously to the Lord's Work The Bible is clear that giving back to God a portion of what he has so generously blessed us with is an act of worship. Give consistently and generously to support the ministries you believe in.\n8. Become More Like Christ Grow in Christlikeness, pursuing the fruits of the Spirit—love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control (Gal. 5:22-23). Make a list of areas in which you'd like to grow as a Christian, and seek out teachings, studies, or mentors to assist you in that growth.\n9. Develop a Servant's Heart Jesus didn't come to be served, but to serve (Matt. 20:28). Seek to do the same, considering ways in which you can give of your time and energy to serve others, both in your congregation and in your wider community.\nSo, while we may not be making resolutions for things of the world, focusing on these spiritual resolutions can undoubtedly be a positive change, increasing our closeness to God, and resulting in a stronger faith walk.\nReflection: Which of these spiritual resolutions call out to you the most? How do you plan to make them a regular part of your routine?\nRelated Article (This article has been revised from an earlier edition, originally published under the title \"9 Resolutions for New Christians\".)\nTo go Deeper: See also our article \"5 Steps to Begin a Personal Bible Reading Plan\".\nResource - The Holy Bible, New International Version Photo Credit: ©sirottiartista via Compfight/CC BY-ND 2.0, ©andythere via Compfight/CC, ©Debbie Ohi via Compfight/CC BY-SA 2.0, ©Lyavov Aleksandr, Aleksandra, Anton Petrus, Lubovstudio, Denzilia, Nikolay Mrossovich, Timothy K Hamilton ‎(all on Unsplash)\nStephanie McComb teaches pastoral studies in the Conservative Baptist Seminary in Italy and serves on the Executive Leadership Team of Women in Christian Ministries International.

Thank you. I must add that reading the Bible will be easier if we pray while reading it. Asking the Holy Spirit to illuminate the passage makes understanding possible for any reader, no matter their experience.\nJack Wellman\nHi Darlene, I absolutely agree with you and that's actually a terrific addition to the list as well. Prayer during reading the Bible allows the Holy Spirit to truly help us understand God's Word far more accurately and deeply. Thanks for adding that important and significant point! Blessings! - Jack Wellman.\nI love these resolutions that challenge us not only to grow, but to maintain a constant and reverent closeness with our savior. It's easy for anyone to stumble, but when you focus on Jesus and the community of love and support that he established for His followers, the hope, the love, and the fulfillment will follow.\nJack Wellman\nVery true, Cathy. Being part of a loving, God-honoring Christian community can make a world of a difference in our faith journey. When we're surrounded by like-minded believers who strive to spur each other on, we can't help but be more aware of our purpose and our mission in sharing the love of Christ with the world. Many blessings! - Jack Wellman.\nThis is a great list. I would add to the point 'Become More Like Christ' the next step, 'Pray for this and diligently ask the Holy Spirit to work on your fruit' If you're to purposefully grow in fruit, it's necessary to let the work be done by the Spirit, who perfects this task in our lives.\nJack Wellman\nYou make a very valid and important point, Heleen. As we seek to grow in Christlikeness, we should ask God and the Holy Spirit to fill in the gaps and provide the necessary growth to manifest more of those fruits, and that includes patience, as God's work in us takes time but is never in vain.
