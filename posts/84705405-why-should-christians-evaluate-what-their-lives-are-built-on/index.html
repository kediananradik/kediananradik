And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and slammed against that house; and yet it did not fall, because it had been founded on the rock\" (Matt 7:24-25).\nJesus used the illustration of a house on a firm foundation to emphasize the importance of building our lives on His words. Many people passively tolerate the Bible while they build their foundations on worldly values. However, Jesus clarifies the need to actively choose a foundation based on His teachings.\n1. To Ensure Enduring Life through Troubles Life's unavoidable troubles, both spiritual and physical, often test our foundations. If the foundation is built on Jesus' words, we'll be equipped to withstand the trials and even turn them into opportunities for growth (2Cor 4:17, Jas 1:2-4).\n2. To Achieve Spiritual Anchoring Building our lives on the words of Jesus provides the spiritual stability that nothing else in this world can give. Scripture reveals our value, purpose, and destiny, while its truth provides an unshakeable bedrock for our lives.\n3. To Bring Clarity in Decision Making When we base our lives on Jesus' words, we're provided with a framework to navigate decisions. God's truth provides clear-cut wisdom and moral guidelines to make choices that honor Him and advance His kingdom.\n4. To Develop a Resilient Character Living by God's word shapes us into resilient people. His truth prepares us for challenges, cultivates peace, and equips us to endure hardship with hope (Rom 5:3-5).\n5. To Avoid Life Built on Unstable Ground Without a commitment to Jesus' teachings, our lives can easily get consumed by temporal, unsteady foundations. The pursuit of self, possessions, or fleeting pleasure leads to discontentment and dissatisfaction.\n6. To Appreciate True Prosperity and Happiness Jesus' words offer the blueprint for true happiness and prosperity (Jn 10:10). Living by them results in an abundant life because we're tapping into God's divine resources, understanding, and purpose.\n7. To Secure Eternal Life More importantly, the foundation of Jesus' words guides us to eternal life with Him in Heaven. The Scripture is a roadmap that leads to salvation in Messiah Jesus (2Tim 3:15, Acts 4:12).\nIn conclusion, living according to Jesus' teachings means building our lives on a firm foundation—a source of life's stability, moral truth, and the assurance of salvation. It's an active commitment to make the words of Jesus the very base of who we are and how we live. This lifestyle allows us to face life's challenges while finding comfort, strength, and joy in Him.\nPhoto Credit: © Getty Images/karmazyna\nMarlena Ziebelski has been in ministry for over a decade, working with youth and young adults, with a heart for evangelism and missions.
